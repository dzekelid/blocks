  x-api-slug: suppressionblocks-delete
  description: "**This endpoint allows you to delete all email addresses on your blocks
    list.**\n\nThere are two options for deleting blocked emails: \n\n1. You can delete
    all blocked emails by setting `delete_all` to true in the request body. \n2. You
    can delete some blocked emails by specifying the email addresses in an array in
    the request body.\n\n[Blocks](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Glossary/blocks.html)
    happen when your message was rejected for a reason related to the message, not
    the recipient address. This can happen when your mail server IP address has been
    added to a blacklist or blocked by an ISP, or if the message content is flagged
    by a filter on the receiving server.\n\nFor more information, please see our [User
    Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Suppressions/blocks.html)."
